# Let's Encrypt Automation With Linode Utility

This is a small utility project meant to automate some tasks when working with Let's Encrypt, CloudFlare and Linode NodeBalancers.\
Easily renew a certificate for a Linode NodeBalancer with a DNS-01 challenge through CloudFlare.

One set up of this project will service one domain.

The project is created in such a way that everything runs in Docker containers to eliminate dependency problems\
and no additional software is required on the machine it is run on.\

Set it up on your local machine or a Docker machine to automate the renewal process.

## Version

1.0.0

## Requirements

- Docker version 25.0.3 (Tested with build 4debf41)
- Docker Compose Version v2.24.6
- Python 3.11.x (Tested with Python 3.11.5)
- OS should be able to run Makefile

## Requirements for auto renewal via cron

- Linux or Unix machine with CRON installed.

## Set up

To get going you will require an API Token for CloudFlare and a Linode CLI / API Token.

- https://cloud.linode.com/profile/tokens - Page to visit for a Linode Access Token.
- https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens - Page to visit for a CloudFlare API Token.

Note: At the time of writing this, global API tokens were still required for CloudFlare. \
It is however better to use new the API tokens with specific privileges where possible.

With these credentials, copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set up the `.env` file in the root of the project.

To get the NodeBalancer you would like to update with Let's Encrypt Certificates the following commands can \
be useful.

```bash
docker run --rm -it -e LINODE_CLI_TOKEN={TOKEN} linode/cli:latest nodebalancers list
docker run --rm -it -e LINODE_CLI_TOKEN={TOKEN} linode/cli:latest nodebalancers configs-list {NODEBALANCER_ID}
```

You can also run the Linode NodeBalancer discovery utility to make this process a little less painless.
Remember that your Linode API token will need to be setup in the `.env` file.

```bash
python3 main.py -d, --nodebalancer-discover
```

There is also a Makefile version of this which you can run.

```bash
make nodebalancer-discover
```

Once the `.env` file is completed, run the initial setup command.

```bash
make setup
```

A successful setup will have no errors and the below output.

```text
CLOUDFLARE SECRETS SETUP COMPLETE
```

For a full set of Makefile options, run `make help` or `make`.

## Get a New Certificate or Initial Certificate Retrieval

```bash
make certbot-new
```

Through Python on your host

```bash
python3 main.py --new-certificate --execute-command
```

## Renew a Certificate

```bash
make certbot-renew
```

Through Python on your host

```bash
python3 main.py --renew-certificate --execute-command
```

## Update Linode NodeBalancer Config

```bash
make linode-update
```

Through Python on your host

```bash
python3 main.py --update-nodebalancer --execute-command
```

## Auto Renewals

To automatically check if a certificate should be renewed, you will have to set up a 
cron job.

Start the crontab editor

```bash
crontab -e
crontab -u [username] -e
```

Add the following line to it. Adjust the frequency of the checks to your preference.
The time set below will check daily at 1am based on the time and timezone set for
your host operating system.

`{path}` Should be set to the root folder where this utility resides.
`make linode-update` will only update the NodeBalancer if the certificate were
renewed.

```bash
#MIN HOUR DOM MON DOW CMD
* 1 * * * cd {path} && make certbot-renew && make linode-update >> {path}/.logs/cron.log 2>&1
```

This same method can be applied to other operating systems like MacOS (Automator) and Windows (Scheduled Tasks), but
I will leave that for you to figure out.


## Python CLI Command Reference

```text
Let's Encrypt Management Tool

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -n, --new-certificate
                        Generate CLI command to get a new certificate through a Docker container.
  -r, --renew-certificate
                        Generate CLI command to renew a certificate through a Docker container.
  -u, --update-nodebalancer
                        Generate CLI command to update your Linode NodeBalancer through a Docker container.
  -s, --cf-setup        CloudFlare Setup of Secrets File.
  -t, --test-output     Generate CLI command to Update Linode NodeBalancer through a Docker container.
  -x, --execute-command
                        Execute the command instead of printing it out to the terminal. This is helpfulwhen running the script directly on the host and not through a Docker container.
  -d, --nodebalancer-discover
                        Discover the Linode NodeBalancer infrastructure.
  -v, --validate-ssl-cert
                        Validate the installed SSL certificate on the domain as configured.
```

nodebalancer-discover          This will discover NodeBalancers on the Linode account the Linode API key was setup for.nodebalancer
certbot-new                    This will issue a new certificate or setup the Let's Encrypt environment with the current certificate.
certbot-renew                  This will attempt to renew the Let's Encrypt certificate.
linode-update                  This updates the Linode NodeBalancer with the current available certificate.
test-python-image              This will test the Python image by running the main.py test method.
```

## Todo
- Make sure the correct number of options can be used with the `main.py` CLI utility. 
- Notification of some kind. (https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/how-to-send-slack-messages-with-python)
